# nanoc-compass-lessframework

This is just a basic structure/configuration for a start if you want to work with the awesome nanoc, compass and lessframework. It's pretty simple to integrate actually but as I've spent a bit of time making it work, I think it's cool to share. Might save you some minutes ;-) 

If I remember well, what you have to do is just:

* Install [nanoc][nanoc_site]
* Install [compass][compass_github]
